            "abstract": "Werner syndrome (WS), caused by mutations in the RecQ helicase WERNER (<i>WRN</i>) gene, is a classical accelerated aging disease with patients suffering from several metabolic dysfunctions without a cure. While, as we previously reported, depleted NAD<sup>+</sup> causes accumulation of damaged mitochondria, leading to compromised metabolism, how mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> changes in WS and the impact on WS pathologies were unknown. We show that loss of WRN increases senescence in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) likely related to dysregulation of metabolic and aging pathways. In line with this, NAD<sup>+</sup> augmentation, via supplementation with nicotinamide riboside, reduces senescence and improves mitochondrial metabolic profiles in MSCs with <i>WRN</i> knockout (<i>WRN<sup>-/-</sup></i>) and in primary fibroblasts derived from WS patients compared to controls. Moreover, <i>WRN</i> deficiency results in decreased mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> (measured indirectly via mitochondrially-expressed PARP activity), and altered expression of key salvage pathway enzymes, including NMNAT1 and NAMPT; ChIP-seq data analysis unveils a potential co-regulatory axis between WRN and the NMNATs, likely important for chromatin stability and DNA metabolism. However, restoration of mitochondrial or cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> is not sufficient to reinstall cellular proliferation in immortalized cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>WRN</i>, highlighting an indispensable role of WRN in proliferation even in an NAD<sup>+</sup> affluent environment. Further cell and animal studies are needed to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, facilitating related drug development.",

            "semantic_string": "Title: NAD<sup>+</sup> centric mechanisms and molecular determinants of skeletal muscle disease and aging. Abstract: The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is an essential redox cofactor, involved in various physiological and molecular processes, including energy metabolism, epigenetics, aging, and metabolic diseases. NAD<sup>+</sup> repletion ameliorates muscular dystrophy and improves the mitochondrial and muscle stem cell function and thereby increase lifespan in mice. Accordingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> is considered as an anti-oxidant and anti-aging molecule. NAD<sup>+</sup> plays a central role in energy metabolism and the energy produced is used for movements, thermoregulation, and defense against foreign bodies. The dietary precursors of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis is targeted to improve NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis; however, studies have revealed conflicting results regarding skeletal muscle-specific effects. Recent advances in the activation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway and supplementation of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors have led to beneficial effects in skeletal muscle pathophysiology and function during aging and associated metabolic diseases. NAD<sup>+</sup> is also involved in the epigenetic regulation and post-translational modifications of proteins that are involved in various cellular processes to maintain tissue homeostasis. This review provides detailed insights into the roles of NAD<sup>+</sup> along with molecular mechanisms during aging and disease conditions, such as the impacts of age-related NAD<sup>+</sup> deficiencies on NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes, including poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARPs), CD38, and sirtuins within skeletal muscle, and the most recent studies on the potential of nutritional supplementation and distinct modes of exercise to replenish the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool.

  "summary": "The majority of the studies suggest that NAD+ supplementation improves healthspan and has beneficial effects on aging and age-related diseases in mammals. However, one study found that while NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide, improved healthspan, it did not extend lifespan in mice.",
  "reasoning": "Article 1 supports the claim, stating that NAD+ repletion improves muscle stem cell function and increases lifespan in mice. It also mentions that NAD+ is considered an anti-aging molecule. Article 2 also supports the claim, stating that increasing NAD+ by supplementation with precursors appears to extend healthspan in model organisms. However, it also mentions that human studies are limited and results are mixed. Article 3 supports the claim, stating that restoring NAD+ levels using supplementation can be a valuable strategy for recovery of age-associated defects. Article 4 supports the claim, stating that supplementation of NAD+ precursors may restore NAD+ levels present in youth and reduce the risk of age-related diseases. However, Article 5 contradicts the claim, stating that while nicotinamide, a precursor of NAD+, improved healthspan in mice, it did not extend lifespan. Despite this, the majority of the articles support the claim that NAD+ supplementation increases lifespan in mammals."
